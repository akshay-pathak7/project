## **Introduction**

In our pursuit to understand global healthcare disparities and their connection to socioeconomic factors. The below infographics showcases the information on **Population**, **GDP per capita**, and **Life expectancy** with various continents and countries within it across years in relation to the percentage of children under the age of 5 years receiving adequate treatment for **Diarrhea**, a critical health indicator.

## Life expectancy

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Here we are looking at <span style='color:blue'>**global landscape**</span> of various <span style='color:red'>**countries**</span> in relation to their <span style='color:green'>**life expectancy**</span>. We are given to understand stark difference in <span style='color:green'>**life expectancy**</span> across regions where some <span style='color:red'>**countries**</span> are boast high <span style='color:green'>**life expectancy**</span> whereas others are way behind. This gives us insights as to how <span style='color:green'>**life expectancy**</span> can impact the **health index** across regions.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: We are now looking at how <span style='color:green'>**life expectancy**</span> varies across <span style='color:blue'>**continents**</span> over time that is from 1960 till date. This gives us insights on healthcare access and its quality. We observe divergent data across continents  where <span style='color:orange'>**Africa**</span> as a whole is worst affected. This highlights the need to improve healthcare access in regions which are not doing well.

## GDP and Diarrhea Treatment

## Treatment of Diarrhea

#| fig-cap: We deep dive into healthcare outcomes, thereby examine disparities in diarrhea treatment access among children. It looks at <span style='color:blue'>**treatment**</span> percentages by <span style='color:green'>**continent**</span>, shedding light on potential disparities in healthcare access. This visualization underscores the importance of healthcare delivery and the need to address underlying <span style='color:orange'>***social determinants of health***</span>.

## ![](stock-vector-black-bulb-with-checkmark-like-quick-tip-icon-flat-stroke-linear-simple-trend-modern-efficiency-2180594735.jpg){width="84"} **Conclusion**

Our visual exploration has illuminated the complex interplay between **socioeconomic** factors, **demographic** trends, and **healthcare** outcomes on a global scale. We have witnessed disparities in **life expectancy**, **economic prosperity**, and **healthcare access** across **continents** and its **countries**, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions to promote equitable healthcare for all. By this, we can make informed decisions on policies and practices aimed at improving healthcare access, quality, and outcomes worldwide. We have embarked on a journey of discovery, uncovering insights that inspire action and advocacy for a ***healthier, more equitable world.***
